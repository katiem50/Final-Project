<h2> May 8, 2015 </h2>
<p>This is my first blog post on this new blog. This is the part of the website where I combine my major and minor. My goal for this blog is to update it once a week and talk about an important historical event that happen that day. Ok here we go</p>

<p> Today is V-E day. It is the 70th anniversary of V-E Day to be exact. For those of you that do not know V-E stands for Victory in Europe. That means 70 years ago today fighting stopped, marking the end of World War II in Europe.</p>

<p> Fighting had been going on in Europe for nearly 6 years. After D-Day on June 6, 1944 the Allies were beginning soundly defeat the Axis powers. They had surrounded the Axis and were coming at them from all sides. It was only a matter of time before defeat would be handed down. </p> <img src="https://carpetbaggery.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/ve-day.jpg">

<p> The first to fall was Mussolini. He was shot and killed on April 28, 1945 thus ending his Fascist Party's control of Italy. All that stood in front of Allie victory was Hitler. By the time of Mussolini's death the Battle of Berlin was in full swing and the Allies were closing in on Hitler's bunker. Rather than face death at the hands of the Allies, Hitler took his own live on April 30, 1945, just two days after the death of Mussolini. </p>

<p> Without Hitler's leadership, there was no hope for the Axis powers. Just a week after Hitler's death, the Nazi's surrendered. They surrender first in Reims, France on May 7 and then again on May 8 in Berlin, Germany. Celebrations broke out all over the world. More than 1 million people gathered outside Buckingham Palace in London, to see King George VI, Princess Elizabeth, and Winston Churchill on the balcony. In the United States, this victory was much welcomed good news, as the country was still in morning after it had lost President Franklin Roosevelt less than a month before. Thousands if not millions met to celebrate in New York City's Times Square. Victory was also a much appreciated birthday present to new President Truman who was celebrating his 61st. </p> <img src="https://royalhats.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/1945-05-08-v-day.jpg?w=869">

<p> Celebrations and memorials are planed all over the world. In Washington they will mark the day by flying old World War II fighter planes over the National Mall as we remember those who fought for our Victory 70 years ago. </p>
