  Hi, I'm Katie...
</h2>
 <div id="introwords"
 <p>I am 21-years-old and grew up in Franklin, TN. I am currently a junior at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, PA. I am majoring in Communications and minoring in History.
 After graduation I hope to combine both my major and minor and work in a museum.</p> <p>Writing and history are two of passions and I have combined both of them to create my blog. I encourage you to read it is really good I promise. I also have included more about my education in the about me tab so if you are interested feel free to click the link.</p>
 <p> Well, Thanks for clicking on my website and I hope you enjoy your stay. </p>
